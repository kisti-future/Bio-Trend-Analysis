# Bio-Trend-Analysis with GridaBio Series

## GridaBio Series is a biomedical information search tool series developed by KISTI. Currently, two information search tools, GridaMed and GridaClinical, have been released. 


### GridaMed

- GridaMed is an application that applies to PubMedâ€™s index and citation information search system of the life science and medical literature database. 
 (PubMed : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)

- GridaMed is an application that visualizes the latest research trends in the life sciences, medical and agro-food sectors as a MeSH keyword network graph.

 (MeSH : Medical Subject Headings is the NML controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles for PubMed.)

- GridaMed not only makes it easy to visualize and identify the latest research trends through the thematic MeSH network graphs (MeSH Net), but also helps you quickly navigate through PubMed literature and clinical trial information ClinicalTrials.gov by clink-and-link MeSH nodes.

- You can get the publication about GridaMed from https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/6/1113 


### GridaClinical

- GridaClinical is an application to the clinical trial database ClinicalTrials.gov that provides users with a relatively easy and accurate way to navigate clinical trial information. 
 (ClinicalTrials.gov : http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)

- GridaClinical is an application that retrieves clinical trial data and generates a table for each item, and visualizes the matrix and bubble chart of any two items as users want to analyze. 

- GridaClinical has the function to search again for specific items in the clinical trial data, making it easier and more accurate to navigate the clinical trial information as users want to find.
